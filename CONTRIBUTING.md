# General Pointers

* Adding code is a cost. Only add code when you have to. Add as little of it
as possible.

* The corollary to the above: if you manage to *remove* code, you are Superman.

* Be polite, even if the other person is an idiot. We are all idiots sometimes.

# GitHub Issues

* The `bug` label is for confirmed bugs â€” that is, bugs that have been
reproduced by a project collaborator. These issues should take priority.

* Issues with no response from OP for 30 days can be closed. OP can reopen
if the issue is still a problem.

# Pull Requests

* Keep your PRs as small as possible. Don't include superfluous changes like:
  * Removing whitespace from unrelated files
  * Changing spellings that are already correct
  * Changing variable names that are already appropriate
  * Changing comment styles

# Coding Standards

* Don't be a coding standards nazi.

* Keep lines to 80 chars or less.

* Don't put little stars at the start of every line in a multiline comment.

* No trailing whitespace.

* Spell things right.
