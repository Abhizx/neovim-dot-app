class Client

    A MsgPack-RPC client for talking to another process on
    the same machine through its stdin/stdout handles.

    Client(Process &)
        When creating the Client, pass the process you want to communicate with.

    RPC *call(string, args)
        Call an RPC with given name and arguments. Returns an RPC pointer.
        When the RPC returns, the RPC pointer will be referenced in an Event
        returned by Client::wait().

        After that, the RPC pointer will not be used anymore and it is the
        caller's responsibility to delete it.

    Event wait()
        Blocks until either an RPC returns, or a note is received. Fills out
        and returns an Event structure detailing what happened.
