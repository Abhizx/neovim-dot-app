class RPC

    Represents an RPC call that we've made to a Client.

    Get one of these by calling Client::call(name, args).

    is_resolved()
        True if the RPC has returned; False if we're still waiting for
        the other process to get back to us.

    get_value()
        The return value of this RPC. Nil if it hasn't returned or has
        errored.

    get_error()
        If the RPC resulted in an error, this returns the error object.
        Otherwise, it returns nil.
